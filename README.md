# British-Airways-Project
This project analyzes the data from the British airways reviews file that showcase different metrics that users reviewed. The goal in mind for this data was to create an Interactive dashboard that is very convenient for the end-user. 
Data source- ba.reviews.csv - this file containst the different metrics that were reviewed upon by the customer of british airways. 
Data source- Countries.csv - this file contains the different countries that were traveld to or from that also held a review. 

Joining the data in tableau through a relationship and creating a parameter that showcased all the metrics to be used throughout the data source the baseline of the needed data was created. A map that shows all the countires the revies came from, the amount of reviews and the average rating of the reviews from that country. Crated a top horizontal bar for the review numbers to be showcased, also creating an Overall-Rating to showcase the Overall performance of the aircraft. The metrics were selected to showcase the average of the data as to give a more efficient and overall look to the data and giving the end-user better data in terms of relevence. a line graph showing the reviews of the metrics over a given date as well as a bar graph to showcase the average metric by aircraft. took all these visualizations and creating an interactive dashboard that I invite you to check.
